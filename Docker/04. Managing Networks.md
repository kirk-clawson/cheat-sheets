- Docker Containers are attached to virtual networks every time you create or start them. Some of these networks are created by default, others must be specifically identified. To create a container attached to a specific network, you can run:
```shell
docker run --network my-custom-network rundeck/rundeck
```
- This will create a container from the specified image and attach it to an existing network with the name `my-custom-network`
### Managing networks
- To see all existing networks:
```shell
docker network ls
```
- To disconnect an existing container from its network (remember, all containers will be connected to some default network at creation if not otherwise specified):
```shell
docker network disconnect some-network some-container
```
- To connect an existing container to a network:
```shell
docker network connect some-network some-container
```

### Network Types
- There are 5 types of virtual networks that can be setup for docker containers.
	1. Null
	2. Host
	3. Bridge
	4. MacVLAN
	5. IPVLAN

### The Null Network
- The null network is created by default when you install Docker. The default null network is named `none`. This network is meant for container isolation, and prevents any sort of network access to & from the container.
