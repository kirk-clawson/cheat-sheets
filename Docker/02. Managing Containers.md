### Running an existing Container
[Docker Container Start documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_start/)
To use this command, you will need the container's Name or Id (which can be found via the `docker ps -a` command).
```bash
docker container start <name or id>
```

### Listing all existing containers on the local system
[Docker PS documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/)

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### Connecting the terminal to a running container
[Docker exec documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/)
```bash
docker exec -it my_container bash
```
This will start a bash session in the container named my_container.

Note that bash is only available on certain containers (i.e. ones derived from \*nix OSes)
Examples of other bash-like command line environments would be `sh` and `powershell`

### Rename an existing container
[Docker rename documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rename/)
```shell
docker rename old_container_name new_container_name
```
