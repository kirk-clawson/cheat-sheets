### Downloading Images from DockerHub
[Docker Pull documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/)
```bash
docker pull rundeck/rundeck
```

### Creating a [Container](<02. Managing Containers.md>) from an Image
[Docker Run documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)
This creates a container from the named image with all default options for things like network, ports, and volumes, along with a randomly-generated container name.
```bash
docker run rundeck/rundeck
```

A more flexible usage would be
```bash
docker run --network my-custom-network -p 8080:80 -v /foo/bar:/baz/qux --name rundeck rundeck/rundeck
```
In this example, a container is created from the rundeck/rundeck image with these attributes:
1. It is attached to a [custom network](<04. Managing Networks.md>) called 'my-custom-network'
2. Port 80 from the container is being mapped to port 8080 of the host
	1. Generally, you will expose a port _or_ attach to a custom network, rarely will you do both
3. The path /baz/qux inside the container is mapped to the host path of /foo/bar
4. The container is being given the name 'rundeck' instead of a randomly-generated name

### Listing all images on the local host
[Docker images documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images/)
```bash
docker images
```
