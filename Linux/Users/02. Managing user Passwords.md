### Changing your password
```shell
passwd
```
- You will be prompted for your current password, then a new password which needs to be entered a second time to confirm.
- If the new password does not fufill the complexity requirements set by the system's PAM module, though, you will ahve to pick a different password, or force the use of the unsecure password:
```shell
sudo su
passwd <username>
```
