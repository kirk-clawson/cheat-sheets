### Allow Root Access
- In Debian-based distros, the root user is automatically disabled. It is assumed that all admin tasks will be done via `sudo` by an admin user set up during the install process.
- In Arch distros, the install process has you set up root separately from an admin user.

To enable root in Debian distros:
```shell
sudo -i
passwd
```
- Setting a root password enables the root user and they can now log in directly.

### Allowing root to log in via SSH
- First, ensure ssh is installed
```shell
which ssh
```
- This should respond with something like `/usr/bin/ssh` or similar. If not, install it:
```shell
apt install open-ssh
```
- Next, ensure that the SSH service is running:
```shell
systemctl status ssh
```
- The response should include a status similar to `Active: active (running)` . If not, start the service:
```shell
systemctl enable ssh.service
```
- Finally, ensure that root is allowed to log in via SSH by editing a line from the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` :
```shell
FROM:
#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
TO:
PermitRootLogin yes
```
Then, restart the service:
```shell
systemctl restart ssh
```
