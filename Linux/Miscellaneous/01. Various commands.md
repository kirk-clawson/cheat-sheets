### Checking free RAM space
- This command presents a human readable output of the various RAM usages on the machine
```shell
free -h
```
- To see the RAM usage as it changes over time, the output can be repeated every X seconds:
```shell
free -h -s 5
```

### System Logs
- The easiest way to check the system logs:
```shell
dmesg -T
```
- To prune the output to something specific (like OOM Killer messages in this example):
```shell
dmesg -T | grep -i 'killed process'
```
