### Mounting a drive
- To mount a drive to a specific filesystem location, two things have to happen. 
	1. The root directory where the mount will be placed has to exist in the filesystem.
	2. Mount the drive to the filesystem.
```shell
# create the filesystem root
cd /
mkdir mount-root
# mount the drive
sudo mount /dev/sda4 /mount-root
```
- If the drive happens to be an NFS share from a file server, the mount syntax is slightly different:
```shell
sudo mount -t nfs <server-ip>:/nfs-volume/nfs-share /mount-root
```
### Mounting a drive at boot time
- To mount a drive at boot time, you'll have to edit the file /etc/fstab as root. Each entry in fstab looks like this:
```shell
/dev/disk/by-uuid/e8b60a4a-3626-476e-8d82-e2096440ed61 /data auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
```
