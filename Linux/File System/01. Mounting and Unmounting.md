### Mounting a drive
- To mount a drive to a specific filesystem location, two things have to happen. 
	1. The root directory where the mount will be placed has to exist in the filesystem.
	2. Mount the drive to the filesystem.
```shell
# create the filesystem root
cd /
mkdir mount-root
# mount the drive
sudo mount /dev/sda4 /mount-root
```
- If the drive happens to be an NFS share from a file server, the mount syntax is slightly different:
```shell
sudo mount -t nfs <server-ip>:/nfs-volume/nfs-share /mount-root
```

### Mounting a drive at boot time
- To mount a drive at boot time, you'll have to edit the file /etc/fstab as root. Each entry in fstab looks like this:
```shell
/dev/sda4 /mount-root auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
```
- To mount an nfs share at boot time, add an entry to /etc/fstab similar to this:
```shell
<server-ip>:/nfs-volume/nfs-share /mount-root nfs defaults,retry=0,bg,x-gvfs-show 0 0
```
- retry=0 and bg options ensure the host doesn't hang during boot if the nfs volume is slow to respond (i.e. a hibernating NAS system taking several seconds to wake)
- x-gvfs-show is for gnome desktops only, and will show the mounted drive in the "Places" list in the gnome files application. If you do not have gnome, or do not want to see this mount as a separate entry, omit this option.

### Unmounting a drive
- To unmount a drive:
```shell
sudo umount /mount-root
```
- This command may hang if the mount is an nfs volume that is no longer responding on the network. In those cases, use this command:
```shell
sudo umount -lf /mount-root
```
- If you
