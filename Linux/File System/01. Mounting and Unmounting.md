### Mounting a drive
- To mount a drive to a specific filesystem location, two things have to happen. 
	1. The filesystem root directory where the mount will be placed has to exist:
	       ```shell
	       cd /
	       mkdir mount-root 
	       ```
	2. The drive then gets mounted to the filesystem location:
```shell
cd /
mkdir mount-root
```
