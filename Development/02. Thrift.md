1. Download the tarball from the Apache archive: http://archive.apache.org/dist/thrift/
2. Extract the tarball to a local directory, and cd into it.
3. Compile:
  - If your nexus repo already has lib-thrift available in it, then you only need to create and install the compiler:
```shell
./configure --disable-libs --disable-tests --disable-tutorial
make
sudo make install
```
  - If you need to build the java lib:
	1. Run `./configure --disable-tests --disable-tutorial`
	2. cd into `/lib/java`
	3. Make the following edits:
		1. In the `build.properties` file, edit the `mv.repo` property to use https instead of http
		2. In the `build.xml` file, in the compile step
