1. Download the tarball from the Apache archive: http://archive.apache.org/dist/thrift/
2. Extract the tarball to a local directory, and cd into it.
3. Compile:
  - If your nexus repo already has lib-thrift available in it, then you only need to create and install the compiler:
```shell
./configure --disable-libs --disable-tests --disable-tutorial
make
sudo make install
```
  - If you need to build the java lib:
	1. Run `./configure --disable-tests --disable-tutorial`
	2. cd into `/lib/java`
	3. Make the following edits:
		1. In the `build.properties` file, edit the `mv.repo` property to use https instead of http
		2. In the `build.xml` file, in the compile target (~ line 97) edit the javac source and target versions both to 1.6
	4. Run `make`. Depending on your system setup, you may get errors during the Python or Node build sections. You can safely ignore those if you are not using thrift with those environments.
		1. The important piece is the java section which you will have to scroll up to see the console output from
	5. Run `sudo make install`
	6. This will install the compiler, it is up to you to grab the thrift jar file out of the java folder and include it/add it to your repo.
